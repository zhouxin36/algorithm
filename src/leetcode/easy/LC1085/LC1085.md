# [*1085. Sum of Digits in the Minimum Number 最小元素个位数之和](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-digits-in-the-minimum-number/)

Given an array A of positive integers, let S be the sum of the digits of the minimal element of A.

Return 0 if S is odd, otherwise return 1.

 ```
Input: [99,77,33,66,55]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
The minimal element is 33, and the sum of those digits is S = 3 + 3 = 6 which is even, so the answer is 1.
 ```


Note:

1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i].length <= 100
