# [1410. HTML Entity Parser HTML实体解析器](https://leetcode.com/problems/html-entity-parser/)
* HTML entity parser is the parser that takes HTML code as input and replace all the entities of the special characters by the characters itself.
* The special characters and their entities for HTML are:
    * Quotation Mark: the entity is &quot; and symbol character is ".
    * Single Quote Mark: the entity is &apos; and symbol character is '.
    * Ampersand: the entity is &amp; and symbol character is &.
    * Greater Than Sign: the entity is &gt; and symbol character is >.
    * Less Than Sign: the entity is &lt; and symbol character is <.
    * Slash: the entity is &frasl; and symbol character is /.
* Given the input text string to the HTML parser, you have to implement the entity parser.
* Return the text after replacing the entities by the special characters.
```text
Input: text = "&amp; is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not."
Output: "& is an HTML entity but &ambassador; is not."
Explanation: The parser will replace the &amp; entity by &

Input: text = "and I quote: &quot;...&quot;"
Output: "and I quote: \"...\""

Input: text = "Stay home! Practice on Leetcode :)"
Output: "Stay home! Practice on Leetcode :)"

Input: text = "x &gt; y &amp;&amp; x &lt; y is always false"
Output: "x > y && x < y is always false"

Input: text = "leetcode.com&frasl;problemset&frasl;all"
Output: "leetcode.com/problemset/all"
```
Constraints:
* 1 <= text.length <= 10^5
* The string may contain any possible characters out of all the 256 ASCII characters.
