# [1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid 绘制N*3网格数量](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ways-to-paint-n-3-grid/)
* You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colours: Red, Yellow or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same colour (i.e no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same colour).
* You are given n the number of rows of the grid.
* Return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 10^9 + 7.
```text
Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown:

Input: n = 2
Output: 54

Input: n = 3
Output: 246

Input: n = 7
Output: 106494

Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214
```
Constraints:
* n == grid.length
* grid[i].length == 3
* 1 <= n <= 5000
