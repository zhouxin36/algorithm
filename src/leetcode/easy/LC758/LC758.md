# [* 758.Bold Words in String 字符串中的加粗单词](https://leetcode.com/problems/bold-words-in-string/)
* Given a set of keywords words and a string S, make all appearances of all keywords in S bold. Any letters between <b> and </b> tags become bold.
* The returned string should use the least number of tags possible, and of course the tags should form a valid combination.
```text
For example, given that words = ["ab", "bc"] and S = "aabcd", 
we should return "a<b>abc</b>d". 
Note that returning "a<b>a<b>b</b>c</b>d" would use more tags, so it is incorrect.
```
Note:
* words has length in range [0, 50].
* words[i] has length in range [1, 10].
* S has length in range [0, 500].
* All characters in words[i] and S are lowercase letters.
