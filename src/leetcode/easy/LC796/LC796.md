# [796. Rotate String 旋转字符串](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string/)
* We are given two strings, A and B.
* A shift on A consists of taking string A and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if A = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on A. Return True if and only if A can become B after some number of shifts on A.
```text
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'
Output: true

Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'
Output: false
```
Note:
* A and B will have length at most 100.
